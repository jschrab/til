# Details about Military Addresses

"...There are a number of United States overseas military addresses and while they are not all technically APO (Army Post Office) this is typically the term that is used when shipping to deployed soldiers. The other option is FPO (Fleet Post Office) for the U.S. Navy and Marines Corps. The ZIP Code acronyms for the APO/FPO addresses are **AE** – Armed Forces Middle East/Africa, **AA** – Armed Forces Americas, and **AP** – Armed Forces Pacific [and **AE** - Armed Forces Europe, etc.]..."
